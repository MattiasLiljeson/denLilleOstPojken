# The Little Cheeseboy aka "Den lille Ostpojken"
### About
This is a game made in a project course at Blekinge Institute of Technology. The game is a pacman clone with a twist. More information can be found [here](http://www.indiedb.com/games/the-little-cheese-boy).    

There has been no polishing whatsoever in deployment of the development environment. You need to add all dependencies in the bin and external folders yourself. Documents describing which files and which folders that should be added to the external and bin folders has been added to their respective folder. The linux build uses a set of custom makefiles which hasn't been tested on other computers other than our Ubuntu linux dev-machine. A working linux build _could_ therefore be a non smooth sailing process.
